background: |
  Dr. Emily Chen, 41, opened Main Street Dental eight years ago after
  completing her residency. She chose a small private practice over
  joining a large dental group because she values the personal
  relationships she builds with patients and their families.

  Dr. Chen is focused primarily on patient care but understands that
  a healthy practice requires solid financial management. She relies
  heavily on her accountant for insurance billing complexities and
  ensuring compliance with healthcare financial regulations.
